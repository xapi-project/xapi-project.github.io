## The [xapi toolstack](http://www.xenproject.org/developers/teams/xapi.html)

- manages clusters of Xen hosts with shared storage and networking
- allows running VMs to be migrated between hosts (with or without storage)
  with minimal downtime
- automatically restarts VMs after host failure
  ([High Availability](features/HA/HA.html))
- allows cross-site [Disaster Recovery](features/DR/DR.html)
- simplifies maintenance through [Rolling Pool Upgrade](features/RPU/RPU.html)
- collects performance statistics for historical analysis and for alerting
- has a full-featured
  [XML-RPC and JSON-RPC based API](xen-api/index.html),
  used by clients such as
  [XenCenter](https://github.com/xenserver/xenadmin),
  [Xen Orchestra](https://xen-orchestra.com),
  [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org)
  and [CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org)

The xapi toolstack is developed by the
[xapi project](http://www.xenproject.org/developers/teams/xapi.html):
a sub-project of the Linux Foundation Xen Project.
