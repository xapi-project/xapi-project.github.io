asked to manage. This means that it can co-exist with other VM managers
such as &lsquo;xl&rsquo; and &rsquo;libvirt&rsquo;.</li><li>Be independent: Xenopsd should be able to work in isolation. In particular
the loss of some other component (e.g. the network) should not by itself
prevent VMs being managed locally (including shutdown and reboot).</li><li>Asynchronous by default: Xenopsd exposes task monitoring and offers
cancellation for all operations. Xenopsd ensures that the system is always
in a manageable state after an operation has been cancelled.</li><li>Avoid state duplication: where another component owns some state, Xenopsd
will always defer to it. We will avoid creating out-of-sync caches of
this state.</li><li>Be debuggable: Xenopsd will expose diagnostic APIs and tools to allow
its internal state to be inspected and modified.</li></ol><footer class=footline></footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Xenopsd</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=architecture>Architecture</h1><p>Xenopsd instances run on a host and manage VMs on behalf of clients.

&ldquo;xenopsd-xenlight&rdquo;.</p><p><a href=#image-c4b566f0d4b597cd170e7d5f49d5bd91 class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/xenopsd/architecture/host.svg alt="Where xenopsd fits on a host" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

never ask more than one Xenopsd to manage the same VM.
Managing a VM means:</p><ul><li>handling start/shutdown/suspend/resume/migrate/reboot</li><li>allowing devices (disks, nics, PCI cards, vCPUs etc) to be manipulated</li><li>providing updates to clients when things change (reboots, console becomes
available, guest agent says something etc).</li></ul><p>For a full list of features, consult the <a href=/new-docs/xenopsd/architecture/features.html>features list</a>.</p><p>Each Xenopsd instance has a unique name on the host. A typical name is</p><ul><li>org.xen.xcp.xenops.classic</li><li>org.xen.xcp.xenops.xenlight</li></ul><p>A higher-level tool, such as <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api target=_blank>xapi</a>
will associate VMs with individual Xenopsd names.</p><p>Running multiple Xenopsds is necessary because</p><ul><li>The virtual hardware supported by different technologies (libxc, libxl, qemu)
is expected to be different. We can guarantee the virtual hardware is stable
across a rolling upgrade by running the VM on the old Xenopsd. We can then switch
Xenopsds later over a VM reboot when the VM admin is happy with it. If the
VM admin is unhappy then we can reboot back to the original Xenopsd again.</li><li>The suspend/resume/migrate image formats will differ across technologies
(again libxc vs libxl) and it will be more reliable to avoid switching
technology over a migrate.</li><li>In the future different security domains may have different Xenopsd instances
providing even stronger isolation guarantees between domains than is possible
today.</li></ul><p>Communication with Xenopsd is handled through a Xapi-global library:
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-idl target=_blank>xcp-idl</a>. This library supports</p><ul><li>message framing: by default using HTTP but a binary framing format is
available</li><li>message encoding: by default we use JSON but XML is also available</li><li>RPCs over Unix domain sockets and persistent queues.</li></ul><p>This library allows the communication details to be changed without having to
change all the Xapi clients and servers.</p><p>Xenopsd has a number of &ldquo;backends&rdquo; which perform the low-level VM operations
such as (on Xen) &ldquo;create domain&rdquo; &ldquo;hotplug disk&rdquo; &ldquo;destroy domain&rdquo;. These backends
contain all the hypervisor-specific code including</p><ul><li>connecting to Xenstore</li><li>opening the libxc /proc/xen/privcmd interface</li><li>initialising libxl contexts</li></ul><p>The following diagram shows the internal structure of Xenopsd:</p><p><a href=#image-fedf076654d49e30bfe9480c7b1d0b52 class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/xenopsd/architecture/xenopsd.svg alt="Inside xenopsd" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

and the other to fetch the latest events. The RPCs are all defined in
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-idl/blob/master/xen/xenops_interface.ml target=_blank>xcp-idl/xen/xenops_interface.ml</a>.
The RPCs are received by the Xenops_server module and decomposed into
&ldquo;micro-ops&rdquo; (labelled &ldquo;Î¼ op&rdquo;). These micro ops represent actions like</p><ul><li>create a Xen domain (recall a Xen domain is an empty shell with no memory)</li><li>build a Xen domain: this is where the kernel or hvmloader is copied in</li><li>launch a device model: this is where a qemu instance is started (if one is
required)</li><li>hotplug a device: this involves writing the frontend and backend trees to
Xenstore</li><li>unpause a domain (recall a Xen domain is created in the paused state)</li></ul><p>Each of these micro-ops is represented by a function call in a &ldquo;backend plugin&rdquo;
interface. The micro-ops are enqueued in queues, one queue per VM. There is a
thread pool (whose size can be changed dynamically by the admin) which pulls
micro-ops from the VM queues and calls the corresponding backend function.</p><p>The active backend (there can only be one backend per Xenopsd instance)
executes the micro-ops. The Xenops_server_xen backend in the picture above
talks to libxc, libxl and qemu to create and destroy domains. The backend
also talks to other Xapi services, in particular</p><ul><li>it registers datasources with xcp-rrdd, telling xcp-rrdd to measure I/O
throughput and vCPU utilisation</li><li>it reserves memory for new domains by talking to squeezed</li><li>it makes disks available by calling SMAPIv2 VDI.{at,de}tach, VDI.{,de}activate</li><li>it launches subprocesses by talking to forkexecd (avoiding problems with
accidental fd capture)</li></ul><p>Xenopsd backends are also responsible for monitoring running VMs. In the
Xenops_server_xen backend this is done by watching Xenstore for</p><ul><li>@releaseDomain watch events</li><li>device hotplug status changes</li></ul><p>When such an event happens (for example: @releaseDomain sent when a domain
requests a reboot) the corresponding operation does not happen inline. Instead
the event is rebroadcast upwards to Xenops_server as a signal (for example:
&ldquo;VM <em>id</em> needs some attention&rdquo;) and a &ldquo;VM_stat&rdquo; micro-op is queued in the
appropriate queue. Xenopsd does not allow operations to run on the same VM
in parallel and enforces this by:</p><ul><li>pushing all operations pertaining to a VM to the same queue</li><li>associating each VM queue to at-most-one worker pool thread</li></ul><p>The event takes the form &ldquo;VM <em>id</em> needs some attention&rdquo; and not &ldquo;VM <em>id</em> needs
to be rebooted&rdquo; because, by the time the queue is flushed, the VM may well now
be in a different state. Perhaps rather than being rebooted it now needs to
be shutdown; or perhaps the domain is now in a good state because the reboot
has already happened. The signals sent by the backend to the Xenops_server are
a bit like event channel notifications in the Xen ring protocols: they are
requests to ask someone to perform work, they don&rsquo;t themselves describe the work
that needs to be done.</p><p>An implication of this design is that it should always be possible to answer
the question, &ldquo;what operation should be performed to get the VM into a valid state?&rdquo;.
If an operation is cancelled half-way through or if Xenopsd is suddenly restarted,
it will ask the question about all the VMs and perform the necessary operations.
The operations must be designed carefully to make this work. For example if Xenopsd
is restarted half-way through starting a VM, it must be obvious on restart that
the VM should either be forcibly shutdown or rebooted to make it a valid state
again. Note: we don&rsquo;t demand that operations are performed as transactions;
we only demand that the state they leave the system be &ldquo;sensible&rdquo; in the sense
that the admin will recognise it and be able to continue their work.</p><p>Sometimes this can be achieved through careful ordering of side-effects
within the operations, taking advantage of artifacts of the system such as:</p><ul><li>a domain which has not been fully created will have total vCPU time = 0 and
will be paused. If we see one of these we should reboot it because it may
not be fully intact.</li></ul><p>In the absense of &ldquo;tells&rdquo; from the system, operations are expected to journal
their intentions and support restart after failure.</p><p>There are three categories of metadata associated with VMs:</p><ol><li>system metadata: this is created as a side-effect of starting VMs. This
includes all the information about active disks and nics stored in Xenstore
and the list of running domains according to Xen.</li><li>VM: this is the configuration to use when the VM is started or rebooted.
This is like a &ldquo;config file&rdquo; for the VM.</li><li>VmExtra: this is the runtime configuration of the VM. When VM configuration
is changed it often cannot be applied immediately; instead the VM continues
to run with the previous configuration. We need to track the runtime
configuration of the VM in order for suspend/resume and migrate to work. It
is also useful to be able to tell a client, &ldquo;on next reboot this value will
be <em>x</em> but currently it is <em>x-1</em>&rdquo;.</li></ol><p>VM and VmExtra metadata is stored by Xenopsd in the domain 0 filesystem, in
a simple directory hierarchy.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=design>Design</h1><footer class=footline></footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Design</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=events>Events</h1><ul><li>ids rather than data; inherently coalescable</li><li>blocking poll + async operations implies a client needs 2 connections</li><li>coarse granularity</li><li>similarity and differences with: XenAPI, event channels, xenstore watches</li></ul><p><a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/30cc9a72e8726d1e7501cd01ddb27ced6d53b9be/ocaml/xapi/xapi_xenops.ml#L1467 target=_blank>https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/30cc9a72e8726d1e7501cd01ddb27ced6d53b9be/ocaml/xapi/xapi_xenops.ml#L1467</a></p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=hooks>Hooks</h1><p>There are a number of hook points at which xenopsd may execute certain scripts.

redirect traffic between PVS and VM to pass through the proxy.</p><p>OVS uses rules that match packets. Rules are organised in sets called
tables. A rule can be used to match a packet and to inject it into
another rule set/table table such that a packet can be matched again.</p><p>Furthermore, a rule can set registers associated with a packet which that
can be matched in subsequent rules. In that way, a packet can be tagged
such that it will only match specific rules downstream that match the
tag.</p><p>Xapi configures 3 rule sets:</p><h2 id=table-0---entry-rules>Table 0 - Entry Rules</h2><p>Rules match UDP traffic between VM/PVS, Proxy/VM, and PVS/VM where the

backend (built upon calls to libxc) to the &lsquo;xenlight&rsquo; backend built on top of
the officially supported libxl API.</p><p>During this work, we have come across an incompatibility between the suspend
images created using the &lsquo;classic&rsquo; backend and those created using the new
libxl-based backend. This needed to be fixed to enable RPU to any new version
of XenServer.</p><h2 id=historic-classic-stack>Historic &lsquo;classic&rsquo; stack</h2><p>Prior to this work, xenopsd was involved in the construction of the suspend
image and we ended up with an image with the following format:</p><pre><code>+-----------------------------+
| &quot;XenSavedDomain\n&quot;          |  &lt;-- added by xenopsd-classic
|-----------------------------|
|  Memory image dump          |  &lt;-- libxc
|-----------------------------|
| &quot;QemuDeviceModelRecord\n&quot;   |
|  &lt;size of following record&gt; |  &lt;-- added by xenopsd-classic
|  (a 32-bit big-endian int)  |
|-----------------------------|
| &quot;QEVM&quot;                      |  &lt;-- libxc/qemu
|  Qemu device record         |
+-----------------------------+
</code></pre><p>We have also been carrying a patch in the Xen patchqueue against
xc_domain_restore. This patch (revert_qemu_tail.patch) stopped
xc_domain_restore from attempting to read past the memory image dump. At which
point xenopsd-classic would just take over and restore what it had put there.</p><h2 id=requirements-for-new-stack>Requirements for new stack</h2><p>For xenopsd-xenlight to work, we need to operate without the
revert_qemu_tail.patch since libxl assumes it is operating on top of an
upstream libxc.</p><p>We need the following relationship between suspend images created on one
backend being able to be restored on another backend. Where the backends are
old-classic (OC), new-classic (NC) and xenlight (XL). Obviously all suspend
images created on any backend must be able to be restored on the same backend:</p><pre><code>                OC _______ NC _______ XL
                 \  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  /
                  \__________________/
                    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre><p>It turns out this was not so simple. After removing the patch against
xc_domain_restore and allowing libxc to restore the hvm_buffer_tail, we found
that supsend images created with OC (detailed in the previous section) are not
of a valid format for two reasons:</p><pre><code>i. The &quot;XenSavedDomain\n&quot; was extraneous;
</code></pre><p>ii. The Qemu signature section (prior to the record) is not of valid form.</p><p>It turns out that the section with the Qemu signature can be one of the
following:</p><pre><code>a. &quot;QemuDeviceModelRecord&quot; (NB. no newline) followed by the record to EOF;
b. &quot;DeviceModelRecord0002&quot; then a uint32_t length followed by record;
c. &quot;RemusDeviceModelState&quot; then a uint32_t length followed by record;
</code></pre><p>The old-classic (OC) backend not only uses an invalid signature (since it
contains a trailing newline) but it also includes a length, <em>and</em> the length is
in big-endian when the uint32_t is seen to be little-endian.</p><p>We considered creating a proxy for the fd in the incompatible cases but since
this would need to be a 22-lookahead byte-by-byte proxy this was deemed
impracticle. Instead we have made patched libxc with a much simpler patch to
understand this legacy format.</p><p>Because peek-ahead is not possible on pipes, the patch for (ii) needed to be
applied at a point where the hvm tail had been read completely. We piggy-backed
on the point after (a) had been detected. At this point the remainder of the fd
is buffered (only around 7k) and the magic &ldquo;QEVM&rdquo; is expected at the head of
this buffer. So we simply added a patch to check if there was a pesky newline
and the buffer[5:8] was &ldquo;QEVM&rdquo; and if it was we could discard the first
5 bytes:</p><pre><code>                              0    1    2    3    4    5   6   7   8
Legacy format from OC:  [...| \n | \x | \x | \x | \x | Q | E | V | M |...]

Required at this point: [...|  Q |  E |  V |  M |...]
</code></pre><h2 id=changes-made>Changes made</h2><p>To make the above use-cases work, we have made the following changes:</p><pre><code>1. Make new-classic (NC) not restore Qemu tail (let libxc do it)
    xenopsd.git:ef3bf4b

2. Make new-classic use valid signature (b) for future restore images
    xenopsd.git:9ccef3e

3. Make xc_domain_restore in libxc understand legacy xenopsd (OC) format

4. Remove revert-qemu-tail.patch from Xen patchqueue
    xen-4.3.pq.hg:3f0e16f2141e

5. Make xenlight (XL) use &quot;XenSavedDomain\n&quot; start-of-image signature
    xenopsd.git:dcda545
</code></pre><p>This has made the required use-cases work as follows:</p><pre><code>                OC __134__ NC __245__ XL
                 \  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  /

initial signature (1.) is used to determine whether we are dealing with the
unstructured, &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; suspend image or the new, structured format.</p><p>Each header is two 64-bit integers: the first identifies the header type and
the second is the length of the record that follows in bytes. The following
types have been defined (the ones marked with a (*) have yet to be
implemented):</p><pre><code>* Xenops       : Metadata for the suspend image
* Libxc        : The result of a xc_domain_save
* Libxl*       : Not implemented
* Libxc_legacy : Marked as a libxc record saved using pre-Xen-4.5
* Qemu_trad    : The qemu save file for the Qemu used in XenServer
* Qemu_xen*    : Not implemented
* Demu*        : Not implemented
* End_of_image : A footer marker to denote the end of the suspend image
</code></pre><p>Some of the above types do not have the notion of a length since they cannot be
known upfront before saving and also are delegated to other layers of the stack
on restoring. Specifically these are the memory image sections, libxc and
libxl.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=tasks>Tasks</h1><p>Some operations performed by Xenopsd are blocking, for example:</p><ul><li>suspend/resume/migration</li><li>attaching disks (where the SMAPI VDI.attach/activate calls can perform network

be lost over a process restart. This is desirable since we will also lose the
queued items and the threads, so there is no need to resync on start.</p><p>Note that every operation must ensure that the state of the system is recoverable
on restart by not leaving it in an invalid state. It is not necessary to either
guarantee to complete or roll-back a Task. Tasks are not expected to be
transactional.</p><h2 id=lifecycle-of-a-task>Lifecycle of a Task</h2><p>All Tasks returned by API functions are created as part of the enqueue functions:
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/xenops_server.ml#L1451 target=_blank>queue_operation_*</a>.
Even operations which are performed internally are normally wrapped in Tasks by
the function
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/xenops_server.ml#L1451 target=_blank>immediate_operation</a>.</p><p>A queued operation will be processed by one of the

It will</p><ul><li>set the thread-local debug key to the Task.dbg</li><li>call <code>task.Xenops_task.run</code>, taking care to catch exceptions and update
the <code>task.Xenops_task.state</code></li><li>unset the thread-local debug key</li><li>generate an event on the Task to provoke clients to query the current state.</li></ul><p>Task implementations must update their progress as they work. For the common
case of a compound operation like <code>VM_start</code> which is decomposed into
multiple &ldquo;micro-ops&rdquo; (e.g. <code>VM_create</code> <code>VM_build</code>) there is a useful
helper function
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/xenops_server.ml#L1092 target=_blank>perform_atomics</a>
which divides the progress &lsquo;bar&rsquo; into sections, where each &ldquo;micro-op&rdquo; can have
a different size (<code>weight</code>). A progress callback function is passed into
each Xenopsd backend function so it can be updated with fine granulatiry. For
example note the arguments to
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/xenops_server.ml#L1092 target=_blank>B.VM.save</a></p><p>Clients are expected to destroy Tasks they are responsible for creating. Xenopsd
cannot do this on their behalf because it does not know if they have successfully
queried the Task status/result.</p><p>When Xenopsd is a client of itself, it will take care to destroy the Task
properly, for example see
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/xenops_server.ml#L1451 target=_blank>immediate_operation</a>.</p><h2 id=cancellation>Cancellation</h2><p>The goal of cancellation is to unstick a blocked operation and to return the
system to <em>some</em> valid state, not any valid state in particular.
Xenopsd does not treat operations as transactions;
when an operation is cancelled it may</p><ul><li>fully complete (e.g. if it was about to do this anyway)</li><li>fully abort (e.g. if it had made no progress)</li><li>enter some other valid state (e.g. if it had gotten half way through)</li></ul><p>Xenopsd will never leave the system in an invalid state after cancellation.</p><p>Every Xenopsd operation should unblock and return the system to a valid state within
a reasonable amount of time after a cancel request. This should be as quick as possible
but up to 30s may be acceptable.
Bear in mind that a human is probably impatiently watching a UI say &ldquo;please wait&rdquo;
and which doesn&rsquo;t have any notion of progress itself. Keep it quick!</p><p>Cancellation is triggered by TASK.cancel which calls
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/task_server.ml#L194 target=_blank>cancel</a>.
This</p><ul><li>sets the cancelling boolean</li><li>calls all registered cancel callbacks</li></ul><p>Implementations respond to cancellation by</p><ul><li>if running: periodically call <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/task_server.ml#L213 target=_blank>check_cancelling</a></li><li>if about to block: register a suitable cancel callback safely with <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/task_server.ml#L224 target=_blank>with_cancel</a>.</li></ul><p>Xenopsd&rsquo;s libxc backend can block in 2 different ways, and therefore has 2 different
types of cancel callback:</p><ol><li>cancellable Xenstore watches</li><li>cancellable subprocesses</li></ol><p>Xenstore watches are used for device hotplug and unplug. Xenopsd has to wait for
the backend or for a udev script to do something. If that blocks then we need
a way to cancel the watch. The easiest way to cancel a watch is to watch an
additional path (a &ldquo;cancel path&rdquo;) and delete it, see
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/xc/cancel_utils.ml#L117 target=_blank>cancellable_watch</a>.
The &ldquo;cancel paths&rdquo; are placed within the VM&rsquo;s Xenstore directory to ensure that
cleanup code which does <code>xenstore-rm</code> will automatically &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; all outstanding
watches. Note that we trigger a cancel by deleting rather than creating, to avoid
racing with delete and creating orphaned Xenstore entries.</p><p>Subprocesses are used for suspend/resume/migrate. Xenopsd hands file descriptors
to libxenguest by running a subprocess and passing the fds to it. Xenopsd therefore
gets the process id and can send it a signal to cancel it. See
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/xc/cancel_utils.ml#L117 target=_blank>Cancellable_subprocess.run</a>.</p><h2 id=testing-with-cancel-points>Testing with cancel points</h2><p>Cancellation is difficult to test, as it is completely asynchronous. Therefore
Xenopsd has some built-in cancellation testing infrastructure known as &ldquo;cancel points&rdquo;.
A &ldquo;cancel point&rdquo; is a point in the code where a <code>Cancelled</code> exception could
be thrown, either by checking the cancelling boolean or as a side-effect of
a cancel callback. The
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/task_server.ml#L216 target=_blank>check_cancelling</a>
function increments a counter every time it passes one of these points, and
this value is returned to clients in the
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/xenops_server.ml#L135 target=_blank>Task.debug_info</a>.</p><p>A <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/a365545c3b113fcd4bedecbc9146d4b6e3efbb04/ocaml/xapi/cancel_tests.ml target=_blank>test harness</a>
runs a series of operations. Each operation is first run all the way through to
completion to discover the total number of cancel points. The operation is then
re-run with a
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/f876f9029cf53f14a52bf42a4a3a03265e048926/lib/task_server.ml#L84 target=_blank>request to cancel at a particular point</a>.
The test then waits for the system to stabilise and verifies that it appears to be
in a valid state.</p><h2 id=preventing-tasks-leaking>Preventing Tasks leaking</h2><p>The client who creates a Task must destroy it when the Task is finished, and
they have processed the result. What if a client like xapi is restarted while
a Task is running?</p><p>We assume that, if xapi is talking to a xenopsd, then xapi completely owns it.
Therefore xapi should destroy any completed tasks that it doesn&rsquo;t recognise.</p><p>If a user wishes to manage VMs with xenopsd in parallel with xapi, the user
should run a separate xenopsd.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></section><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=features>Features</h1><h2 id=general>General</h2><ul><li>Pluggable backends including<ul><li>xc: drives Xen via libxc and xenguest</li><li>simulator: simulates operations for component-testing</li></ul></li><li>Supports running multiple instances and backends on the same host, looking

<code>XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-000000000001</code>. The original domain will be removed using
<code>XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-000000000000</code>.</p><p>There are some points called <em>hooks</em> at which <code>xenopsd</code> can execute some script.
Before starting a migration a command is send to the original domain to execute
a pre migrate script if it exists.</p><p>Before starting the migration a command is sent to Qemu using the Qemu Machine Protocol (QMP)
to check that the domain can be suspended (see <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/master/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/device_common.ml target=_blank>xenopsd/xc/device_common.ml</a>).
After checking with Qemu that the VM is suspendable we can start the migration.</p><h2 id=importing-metadata>Importing metadata</h2><p>As for <em>hooks</em>, commands to source domain are sent using <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/tree/master/ocaml/libs/stunnel target=_blank>stunnel</a> a daemon which
is used as a wrapper to manage SSL encryption communication between two hosts on the same
pool. To import metada an XML RPC command is sent to the original domain.</p><p>Once imported it will give us a reference id and will allow to build the new domain
on the destination using the temporary VM uuid <code>XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-000000000001</code>
where <code>XXX...</code> is the reference id of the original VM.</p><h2 id=setting-memory>Setting memory</h2><p>One of the first thing to do is to setup the memory. The backend will check that there
is no ballooning operation in progress. At this point the migration can fail if a
ballooning operation is in progress and takes too much time.</p><p>Once memory checked the daemon will get the state of the VM (running, halted, &mldr;) and
information about the VM are retrieve by the backend like the maximum memory the domain
can consume but also information about quotas for example.
Information are retrieve by the backend from xenstore.</p><p>Once this is complete, we can restore VIF and create the domain.</p><p>The synchronisation of the memory is the first point of synchronisation and everythin
is ready for VM migration.</p><h2 id=vm-migration>VM Migration</h2><p>After receiving memory we can set up the destination domain. If we have a vGPU we need to kick
off its migration process. We will need to wait the acknowledge that indicates that the entry
for the GPU has been well initialized. before starting the main VM migration.</p><p>Their is a mechanism of handshake for synchronizing between the source and the
destination. Using the handshake protocol the receiver inform the sender of the
request that everything has been setup and ready to save/restore.</p><h3 id=vm-restore>VM restore</h3><p>VM restore is a low level atomic operation <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L2684 target=_blank>VM.restore</a>.
This operation is represented by a function call to <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/domain.ml#L1540 target=_blank>backend</a>.
It uses <strong>Xenguest</strong>, a low-level utility from XAPI toolstack, to interact with the Xen hypervisor
and libxc for sending a request of migration to the <strong>emu-manager</strong>.</p><p>After sending the request results coming from <strong>emu-manager</strong> are collected
by the main thread. It blocks until results are received.</p><p>During the live migration, <strong>emu-manager</strong> helps in ensuring the correct state
transitions for the devices and handling the message passing for the VM as
it&rsquo;s moved between hosts. This includes making sure that the state of the
VM&rsquo;s virtual devices, like disks or network interfaces, is correctly moved over.</p><h3 id=vm-renaming>VM renaming</h3><p>Once all operations are done we can rename the VM on the target from its temporary
name to its real UUID. This operation is another low level atomic one
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L1667 target=_blank>VM.rename</a>
that will take care of updating the xenstore on the destination.</p><p>The next step is the restauration of devices and unpause the domain.</p><h3 id=restoring-remaining-devices>Restoring remaining devices</h3><p>Restoring devices starts by activating VBD using the low level atomic operation
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L3674 target=_blank>VBD.set_active</a>. It is an update of Xenstore. VBDs that are read-write must
be plugged before read-only ones. Once activated the low level atomic operation
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L3721 target=_blank>VBD.plug</a>
is called. VDI are attached and activate.</p><p>Next devices are VIFs that are set as active <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L4296 target=_blank>VIF.set_active</a> and plug <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L4394 target=_blank>VIF.plug</a>.
If there are VGPUs we will set them as active now using the atomic <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L3490 target=_blank>VGPU.set_active</a>.</p><p>We are almost done. The next step is to create the device model</p><h4 id=create-device-model>create device model</h4><p>Create device model is done by using the atomic operation <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L2375 target=_blank>VM.create_device_model</a>. This
will configure <strong>qemu-dm</strong> and started. This allow to manage PCI devices.</p><h4 id=pci-plug>PCI plug</h4><p><a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L3399 target=_blank>PCI.plug</a>
is executed by the backend. It plugs a PCI device and advertise it to QEMU if this option is set. It is
the case for NVIDIA SR-IOV vGPUS.</p><p>At this point devices have been restored. The new domain is considered survivable. We can
unpause the domain and performs last actions</p><h3 id=unpause-and-done>Unpause and done</h3><p>Unpause is done by managing the state of the domain using bindings to <a href="https://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=blob;f=tools/libs/ctrl/xc_domain.c;h=f2d9d14b4d9f24553fa766c5dcb289f88d684bb0;hb=HEAD#l76" target=_blank>xenctrl</a>.
Once hypervisor has unpaused the domain some actions can be requested using <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/7ac88b90e762065c5ebb94a8ea61c61bdbf62c5c/ocaml/xenopsd/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L3172 target=_blank>VM.set_domain_action_request</a>.
It is a path in xenstore. By default no action is done but a reboot can be for example
initiated.</p><p>Previously we spoke about some points called <em>hooks</em> at which <code>xenopsd</code> can execute some script. There
is also a hook to run a post migrate script. After the execution of the script if there is one
the migration is almost done. The last step is a handskake to seal the success of the migration
and the old VM can now be cleaned.</p><h1 id=links>Links</h1><p>Some links are old but even if many changes occured they are relevant for a global understanding

They must first tell Xenopsd the VM

A VM configuration is broken down into objects:</p><ul><li>VM: A device-less Virtual Machine</li><li>VBD: A virtual block device for a VM</li><li>VIF: A virtual network interface for a VM</li><li>PCI: A virtual PCI device for a VM</li></ul><p>Treating devices as first-class objects is convenient because we wish to expose

The two interfaces are slightly different because they have different expected
users:</p><ul><li>the XenAPI has many clients which are updated on long release cycles. The
main property needed is backwards compatibility, so that new release of xapi
remain compatible with these older clients. Quite often we will chose to
&ldquo;grandfather in&rdquo; some poorly designed interface simply because we wish to
avoid imposing churn on 3rd parties.</li><li>the Xenopsd API clients are all open-source and are part of the xapi-project.
These clients can be updated as the API is changed. The main property needed
is to keep the interface clean, so that it properly hides the complexity
of dealing with Xen from other components.</li></ul><p>The Xenopsd &ldquo;VM.add&rdquo; function has code like this:</p><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-ocaml data-lang=ocaml><span style=display:flex><span>	<span style=color:#66d9ef>let</span> add&#39; x <span style=color:#f92672>=</span>

All
objects belonging to a VM (recall we only have VMs, VBDs, VIFs, PCIs and not
stand-alone entities like disks) and are placed into a subdirectory named after
the VM e.g.:</p><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex=0><code># ls /run/nonpersistent/xenopsd/xenlight/VM/7b719ce6-0b17-9733-e8ee-dbc1e6e7b701

 ...
}</code></pre></div><p>Xenopsd doesn&rsquo;t have as persistent a notion of a VM as xapi, it is expected that
all objects are deleted when the host is rebooted. However the objects should
be persisted over a simple Xenopsd restart, which is why the objects are stored
in the filesystem.</p><p>Aside: it would probably be more appropriate to store the metadata in Xenstore
since this has the exact object lifetime we need. This will require a more
performant Xenstore to realise.</p><p>Every running Xenopsd process is linked with a single backend. Currently backends
exist for:</p><ul><li>Xen via libxc, libxenguest and xenstore</li><li>Xen via libxl, libxc and xenstore</li><li>Xen via libvirt</li><li>KVM by direct invocation of qemu</li><li>Simulation for testing</li></ul><p>From here we shall assume the use of the &ldquo;Xen via libxc, libxenguest and xenstore&rdquo; (a.k.a.
&ldquo;Xenopsd classic&rdquo;) backend.</p><p>The backend <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/2a476c132c0b5732f9b224316b851a1b4d57520b/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L719 target=_blank>VM.add</a>
function checks whether the VM we have to manage already exists &ndash; and if it does
then it ensures the Xenstore configuration is intact. This Xenstore configuration
is important because at any time a client can query the state of a VM with
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-idl/blob/2e5c3dd79c63e3711227892271a6bece98eb0fa1/xen/xenops_interface.ml#L438 target=_blank>VM.stat</a>
and this relies on certain Xenstore keys being present.</p><p>Once the VM metadata has been registered with Xenopsd, the client can call
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-idl/blob/2e5c3dd79c63e3711227892271a6bece98eb0fa1/xen/xenops_interface.ml#L443 target=_blank>VM.start</a>.
Like all potentially-blocking Xenopsd APIs, this function returns a Task id.
Please refer to the <a href=/new-docs/xenopsd/walkthroughs/VM.start/../design/Tasks.html>Task handling design</a> for a general
overview of how tasks are handled.</p><p>Clients can poll the state of a task by calling <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-idl/blob/2e5c3dd79c63e3711227892271a6bece98eb0fa1/xen/xenops_interface.ml#L404 target=_blank>TASK.stat</a>
but most clients will prefer to use the event system instead.
Please refer to the <a href=/new-docs/xenopsd/walkthroughs/VM.start/../design/Events.html>Event handling design</a> for a general
overview of how events are handled.</p><p>The event model is similar to the XenAPI: clients call a blocking
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-idl/blob/2e5c3dd79c63e3711227892271a6bece98eb0fa1/xen/xenops_interface.ml#L487 target=_blank>UPDATES.get</a>
passing in a token which represents the point in time when the last UPDATES.get
returned. The call blocks until some objects have changed state, and these object
ids are returned (NB in the XenAPI the current object states are returned)
The client must then call the relevant &ldquo;stat&rdquo; function, in this
case <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-idl/blob/2e5c3dd79c63e3711227892271a6bece98eb0fa1/xen/xenops_interface.ml#L404 target=_blank>TASK.stat</a></p><p>The client will be able to see the task make progress and use this to &ndash; for example &ndash;
populate a progress bar in a UI. If the client needs to cancel the task then it
can call the <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-idl/blob/2e5c3dd79c63e3711227892271a6bece98eb0fa1/xen/xenops_interface.ml#L405 target=_blank>TASK.cancel</a>;
again see the <a href=/new-docs/xenopsd/walkthroughs/VM.start/../design/Tasks.html>Task handling design</a> to understand how this is
implemented.</p><p>When the Task has completed successfully, then calls to *.stat will show:</p><ul><li>the power state is Paused</li><li>exactly one valid Xen domain id</li><li>all VBDs have active = plugged = true</li><li>all VIFs have active = plugged = true</li><li>all PCI devices have plugged = true</li><li>at least one active console</li><li>a valid start time</li><li>valid &ldquo;targets&rdquo; for memory and vCPU</li></ul><p>Note: before a Task completes, calls to *.stat will show partial updates e.g.
the power state may be Paused but none of the disks may have become plugged.
UI clients must choose whether they are happy displaying this in-between state
or whether they wish to hide it and pretend the whole operation has happened
transactionally. If a particular client wishes to perform side-effects in
response to Xenopsd state changes &ndash; for example to clean up an external resource
when a VIF becomes unplugged &ndash; then it must be very careful to avoid responding
to these in-between states. Generally it is safest to passively report these
values without driving things directly from them. Think of them as status lights
on the front panel of a PC: fine to look at but it&rsquo;s not a good idea to wire
them up to actuators which actually do things.</p><p>Note: the Xenopsd implementation guarantees that, if it is restarted at any point
during the start operation, on restart the VM state shall be &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; by either
(i) shutting down the VM; or (ii) ensuring the VM is intact and running.</p><p>In the case of <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api target=_blank>xapi</a> every Xenopsd

operations. Each operation corresponds to a list of &ldquo;micro-ops&rdquo;, where there is
no if/then/else. Some of the &ldquo;micro-ops&rdquo; may be a no-op depending on the VM
configuration (for example a PV domain may not need a qemu). In the case of
<code>VM_start vm</code> this decomposes into the sequence:</p><h2 id=1-run-the-vm_pre_start-scripts>1. run the &ldquo;VM_pre_start&rdquo; scripts</h2><p>The <code>VM_hook_script</code> micro-op runs the corresponding &ldquo;hook&rdquo; scripts. The

module and looks for scripts in the hardcoded path <code>/etc/xapi.d</code>.</p><h2 id=2-create-a-xen-domain>2. create a Xen domain</h2><p>The <code>VM_create</code> micro-op calls the <code>VM.create</code> function in the backend.

if it&rsquo;s a resume then the domain configuration stored in the VmExtra database
table must be used</li><li>ask <em>squeezed</em> to create a memory &ldquo;reservation&rdquo; big enough to hold the VM
memory. Unfortunately the domain cannot be created until the memory is free
because domain create often fails in low-memory conditions. This means the
&ldquo;reservation&rdquo; is associated with our &ldquo;session&rdquo; with squeezed; if Xenopsd
crashes and restarts the reservation will be freed automatically.</li><li>create the Domain via the libxc hypercall</li><li>&ldquo;transfer&rdquo; the squeezed reservation to the domain such that squeezed will

This operates a lot like memory ballooning &ndash; Xen creates
lots of vCPUs and then the guest is asked to only use some of them. Every VM
therefore starts with the &ldquo;VCPUs_max&rdquo; setting and co-operative hotplug is
used to reduce the number. Note there is no enforcement mechanism: a VM which
cheats and uses too many vCPUs would have to be caught by looking at the
performance statistics.</li></ol><h2 id=3-build-the-domain>3. build the domain</h2><p>On a Xen system a domain is created empty, and memory is actually allocated

function must</p><ol><li>run pygrub (or eliloader) to extract the kernel and initrd, if necessary</li><li>invoke the <em>xenguest</em> binary to interact with libxenguest.</li><li>apply the <code>cpuid</code> configuration</li><li>store the current domain configuration on disk &ndash; it&rsquo;s important to know
the difference between the configuration you started with and the configuration
you would use after a reboot because some properties (such as maximum memory
and vCPUs) as fixed on create.</li></ol><p>The xenguest binary was originally
a separate binary for two reasons: (i) the libxenguest functions weren&rsquo;t
threadsafe since they used lots of global variables; and (ii) the libxenguest
functions used to have a different, incompatible license, which prevent us
linking. Both these problems have been resolved but we still shell out to
the xenguest binary.</p><p>The xenguest binary has also evolved to configure more of the initial domain
state. It also <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/ocaml-xen-lowlevel-libs/blob/master/xenguest-4.4/xenguest_stubs.c#L42 target=_blank>reads Xenstore</a>
and configures</p><ul><li>the vCPU affinity</li><li>the vCPU credit2 weight/cap parameters</li><li>whether the NX bit is exposed</li><li>whether the viridian CPUID leaf is exposed</li><li>whether the system has PAE or not</li><li>whether the system has ACPI or not</li><li>whether the system has nested HVM or not</li><li>whether the system has an HPET or not</li></ul><h2 id=4-mark-each-vbd-as-active>4. mark each VBD as &ldquo;active&rdquo;</h2><p>VBDs and VIFs are said to be &ldquo;active&rdquo; when they are intended to be used by a
particular VM, even if the backend/frontend connection hasn&rsquo;t been established,
or has been closed. If someone calls <code>VBD.stat</code> or <code>VIF.stat</code> then
the result includes both &ldquo;active&rdquo; and &ldquo;plugged&rdquo;, where &ldquo;plugged&rdquo; is true if
the frontend/backend connection is established.
For example xapi will
set <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/30cc9a72e8726d1e7501cd01ddb27ced6d53b9be/ocaml/xapi/xapi_xenops.ml#L1300 target=_blank>VBD.currently_attached</a>
to &ldquo;active || plugged&rdquo;. The &ldquo;active&rdquo; flag is conceptually very similar to the
traditional &ldquo;online&rdquo; flag (which is not documented in the upstream Xen tree
as of Oct/2014 but really should be) except that on unplug, one would set
the &ldquo;online&rdquo; key to &ldquo;0&rdquo; (false) <em>first</em> before initiating the hotunplug. By
contrast the &ldquo;active&rdquo; flag is set to false <em>after</em> the unplug i.e. &ldquo;set_active&rdquo;
calls bracket plug/unplug. If the &ldquo;active&rdquo; flag was set before the unplug
attempt then as soon as the frontend/backend connection is removed clients
would see the VBD as completely dissociated from the VM &ndash; this would be misleading
because Xenopsd will not have had time to use the storage API to release locks
on the disks. By doing all the cleanup before setting &ldquo;active&rdquo; to false, clients
can be assured that the disks are now free to be reassigned.</p><h2 id=5-handle-non-persistent-disks>5. handle non-persistent disks</h2><p>A non-persistent disk is one which is reset to a known-good state on every
VM start. The <code>VBD_epoch_begin</code> is the signal to perform any necessary reset.</p><h2 id=6-plug-vbds>6. plug VBDs</h2><p>The <code>VBD_plug</code> micro-op will plug the VBD into the VM. Every VBD is plugged
in a carefully-chosen order.
Generally, plug order is important for all types of devices. For VBDs, we must
work around the deficiency in the storage interface where a VDI, once attached
read/only, cannot be attached read/write. Since it is legal to attach the same
VDI with multiple VBDs, we must plug them in such that the read/write VBDs
come first. From the guest&rsquo;s point of view the order we plug them doesn&rsquo;t
matter because they are indexed by the Xenstore device id (e.g. 51712 = xvda).</p><p>The function
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/b33bab13080cea91e2fd59d5088622cd68152339/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L1631 target=_blank>VBD.plug</a>
will</p><ul><li>call <code>VDI.attach</code> and <code>VDI.activate</code> in the storage API to make the
devices ready (start the tapdisk processes etc)</li><li>add the Xenstore frontend/backend directories containing the block device
info</li><li>add the extra xenstore keys returned by the <code>VDI.attach</code> call that are
needed for SCSIid passthrough which is needed to support VSS</li><li>write the VBD information to the Xenopsd database so that future calls to
<em>VBD.stat</em> can be told about the associated disk (this is needed so clients
like xapi can cope with CD insert/eject etc)</li><li>if the qemu is going to be in a different domain to the storage, a frontend
device in the qemu domain is created.</li></ul><p>The Xenstore keys are written by the functions
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/b33bab13080cea91e2fd59d5088622cd68152339/xc/device.ml#L486 target=_blank>Device.Vbd.add_async</a>
and
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/b33bab13080cea91e2fd59d5088622cd68152339/xc/device.ml#L550 target=_blank>Device.Vbd.add_wait</a>.
In a Linux domain (such as dom0) when the backend directory is created, the kernel
creates a &ldquo;backend device&rdquo;. Creating any device will cause a kernel UEVENT to fire
which is picked up by udev. The udev rules run a script whose only job is to
stat(2) the device (from the &ldquo;params&rdquo; key in the backend) and write the major
and minor number to Xenstore for blkback to pick up. (Aside: FreeBSD doesn&rsquo;t do
any of this, instead the FreeBSD kernel module simply opens the device in the
&ldquo;params&rdquo; key). The script also writes the backend key &ldquo;hotplug-status=connected&rdquo;.
We currently wait for this key to be written so that later calls to <em>VBD.stat</em>
will return with &ldquo;plugged=true&rdquo;. If the call returns before this key is written
then sometimes we receive an event, call <em>VBD.stat</em> and conclude erroneously
that a spontaneous VBD unplug occurred.</p><h2 id=7-mark-each-vif-as-active>7. mark each VIF as &ldquo;active&rdquo;</h2><p>This is for the same reason as VBDs are marked &ldquo;active&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=8-plug-vifs>8. plug VIFs</h2><p>Again, the order matters. Unlike VBDs,
there is no read/write read/only constraint and the devices
have unique indices (0, 1, 2, &mldr;) <em>but</em> Linux kernels have often (always?)
ignored the actual index and instead relied on the order of results from the
<code>xenstore-ls</code> listing. The order that xenstored returns the items happens
to be the order the nodes were created so this means that (i) xenstored must
continue to store directories as ordered lists rather than maps (which would
be more efficient); and (ii) Xenopsd must make sure to plug the vifs in
the same order. Note that relying on ethX device numbering has always been a
bad idea but is still common. I bet if you change this lots of tests will
suddenly start to fail!</p><p>The function
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/b33bab13080cea91e2fd59d5088622cd68152339/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L1945 target=_blank>VIF.plug_exn</a>
will</p><ul><li>compute the port locking configuration required and write this to a well-known
location in the filesystem where it can be read from the udev scripts. This
really should be written to Xenstore instead, since this scheme doesn&rsquo;t work
with driver domains.</li><li>add the Xenstore frontend/backend directories containing the network device
info</li><li>write the VIF information to the Xenopsd database so that future calls to
<em>VIF.stat</em> can be told about the associated network</li><li>if the qemu is going to be in a different domain to the storage, a frontend
device in the qemu domain is created.</li></ul><p>Similarly to the VBD case, the function
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/b33bab13080cea91e2fd59d5088622cd68152339/xc/device.ml#L642 target=_blank>Device.Vif.add</a>
will write the Xenstore keys and wait for the &ldquo;hotplug-status=connected&rdquo; key.
We do this because we cannot apply the port locking rules until the backend
device has been created, and we cannot know the rules have been applied
until after the udev script has written the key. If we didn&rsquo;t wait for it then
the VM might execute without all the port locking properly configured.</p><h2 id=9-create-the-device-model>9. create the device model</h2><p>The <code>VM_create_device_model</code> micro-op will create a qemu device model if</p><ul><li>the VM is HVM; or</li><li>the VM uses a PV keyboard or mouse (since only qemu currently has backend
support for these devices).</li></ul><p>The function
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/b33bab13080cea91e2fd59d5088622cd68152339/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L1090 target=_blank>VM.create_device_model_exn</a>
will</p><ul><li>(if using a qemu stubdom) it will create and build the qemu domain</li><li>compute the necessary qemu arguments and launch it.</li></ul><p>Note that qemu (aka the &ldquo;device model&rdquo;) is created after the VIFs and VBDs have
been plugged but before the PCI devices have been plugged. Unfortunately qemu
traditional infers the needed emulated hardware by inspecting the Xenstore
VBD and VIF configuration and assuming that we want one emulated device per
PV device, up to the natural limits of the emulated buses (i.e. there can be
at most 4 IDE devices: {primary,secondary}{master,slave}). Not only does this
create an ordering dependency that needn&rsquo;t exist &ndash; and which impacts migration
downtime &ndash; but it also completely ignores the plain fact that, on a Xen system,
qemu can be in a different domain than the backend disk and network devices.
This hack only works because we currently run everything in the same domain.
There is an option (off by default) to list the emulated devices explicitly
on the qemu command-line. If we switch to this by default then we ought to be
able to start up qemu early, as soon as the domain has been created (qemu will
need to know the domain id so it can map the I/O request ring).</p><h2 id=10-plug-pci-devices>10. plug PCI devices</h2><p>PCI devices are treated differently to VBDs and VIFs.
If we are attaching the device to an
HVM guest then instead of relying on the traditional Xenstore frontend/backend
state machine we instead send RPCs to qemu requesting they be hotplugged. Note
the domain is paused at this point, but qemu still supports PCI hotplug/unplug.
The reasons why this doesn&rsquo;t follow the standard Xenstore model are known only
to the people who contributed this support to qemu.
Again the order matters because it determines the position of the virtual device
in the VM.</p><p>Note that Xenopsd doesn&rsquo;t know anything about the PCI devices; concepts such
as &ldquo;GPU groups&rdquo; belong to higher layers, such as xapi.</p><h2 id=11-mark-the-domain-as-alive>11. mark the domain as alive</h2><p>A design principle of Xenopsd is that it should tolerate failures such as being
suddenly restarted. It guarantees to always leave the system in a valid state,
in particular there should never be any &ldquo;half-created VMs&rdquo;. We achieve this for
VM start by exploiting the mechanism which is necessary for reboot. When a VM
wishes to reboot it causes the domain to exit (via SCHEDOP_shutdown) with a
&ldquo;reason code&rdquo; of &ldquo;reboot&rdquo;. When Xenopsd sees this event <code>VM_check_state</code>
operation is queued. This operation calls
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/b33bab13080cea91e2fd59d5088622cd68152339/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L1443 target=_blank>VM.get_domain_action_request</a>
to ask the question, &ldquo;what needs to be done to make this VM happy now?&rdquo;. The
implementation checks the domain state for shutdown codes and also checks a
special Xenopsd Xenstore key. When Xenopsd creates a Xen domain it sets this
key to &ldquo;reboot&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;please reboot me if you see me&rdquo;) and when Xenopsd
finishes starting the VM it clears this key. This means that if Xenopsd crashes
while starting a VM, the new Xenopsd will conclude that the VM needs to be rebooted
and will clean up the current domain and create a fresh one.</p><h2 id=12-unpause-the-domain>12. unpause the domain</h2><p>A Xenopsd VM.start will always leave the domain paused, so strictly speaking
this is a separate &ldquo;operation&rdquo; queued by the client (such as xapi) after the
VM.start has completed. The function
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xenopsd/blob/b33bab13080cea91e2fd59d5088622cd68152339/xc/xenops_server_xen.ml#L808 target=_blank>VM.unpause</a>
