It allow the administrator to:
Configure the hardware resources of XenServer hosts: storage, networking, graphics, memory. Create, configure and destroy VMs and their virtual resources. Control the lifecycle of VMs. Monitor the status of hosts, VMs and related resources. To this, the Toolstack:
Exposes an API that can be accessed by external clients over HTTP(s). Exposes a CLI.</description></item><item><title>High-level architecture</title><link>https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/toolstack/high-level/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/toolstack/high-level/index.html</guid><description>The XAPI Toolstack manages a cluster of hosts, network switches and storage on behalf of clients such as XenCenter and Xen Orchestra.
The most fundamental concept is of a Resource pool: the whole cluster managed as a single entity. The following diagram shows a cluster of hosts running xapi, all sharing some storage:
At any time, at most one host is known as the pool coordinator (formerly known as &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo;) and is responsible for coordination and locking resources within the pool.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/toolstack/features/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/toolstack/features/index.html</guid><description> Disaster Recovery Event handling in the Control Plane - Xapi, Xenopsd and Xenstore High-Availability Multi-version drivers NUMA Snapshots vGPU Xapi Storage Migration</description></item></channel></rss>
