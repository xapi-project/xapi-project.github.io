However migration introduces additional delays and is best avoided for entire VMs.</p><p>The latter (soft pinning) is preferred: running a workload now, even on a potentially suboptimal pCPU (higher NUMA latency) is still better than not running it at all and waiting until a pCPU is freed up.</p><p>Xen will also allocate memory for the VM according to the vCPU (soft) pinning: if the vCPUs are pinned only to NUMA nodes A and B, then it will allocate the VM&rsquo;s memory from NUMA nodes A and B (in a round-robin way, resulting in interleaving).</p><p>By default (no pinning) it will interleave memory from all NUMA nodes, which provides average performance, but individual tasks&rsquo; performance may be significantly higher or lower depending on which NUMA node the application may have &ldquo;landed&rdquo; on.
Furthermore restarting processes will speed them up or slow them down as address space randomization picks different memory regions inside a VM.</p><p>Note that this is not the worst case: the worst case would be for memory to be allocated on one NUMA node, but the vCPU always running on the furthest away NUMA node.</p><h2 id=best-effort-numa-aware-memory-allocation-for-vms>Best effort NUMA-aware memory allocation for VMs</h2><p>By default Xen stripes the VM&rsquo;s memory accross all NUMA nodes of the host, which means that every VM has to go through all the interconnects.
The goal here is to find a better allocation than the default, not necessarily an optimal allocation.
An optimal allocation would require knowing what VMs you would start/create in the future, and planning across hosts too.</p><p>Overall we want to balance the VMs across NUMA nodes, such that we use all NUMA nodes to take advantage of the maximum memory bandwidth available on the system.
For now this proposed balancing will be done only by balancing memory usage: always heuristically allocating VMs on the NUMA node that has the most available memory.
Note that this allocation has a race condition for now when multiple VMs are booted in parallel, because we don&rsquo;t wait until Xen has constructed the domain for each one (that&rsquo;d serialize domain construction, which is currently parallel).
This may be improved in the future by having an API to query Xen where it has allocated the memory, and to explicitly ask it to place memory on a given NUMA node (instead of best_effort).</p><p>If a VM doesn&rsquo;t fit into a single node then it is not so clear what the best approach is.
One criteria to consider is minimizing the NUMA distance between the nodes chosen for the VM.
Large NUMA systems may not be fully connected in a mesh requiring multiple hops to each a node, or even have assymetric links, or links with different bitwidth.
These tradeoff should be approximatively reflected in the ACPI SLIT tables, as a matrix of distances between nodes.
It is possible that 3 NUMA nodes have a smaller average/maximum distance than 2, so we need to consider all possibilities.</p><p>For N nodes there would be 2^N possibilities, so [Topology.NUMA.candidates] limits the number of choices to 65520+N (full set of 2^N possibilities for 16 NUMA nodes, and a reduced set of choices for larger systems).</p><p>[Topology.NUMA.candidates] is a sorted sequence of node sets, in ascending order of maximum/average distances.
Once we&rsquo;ve eliminated the candidates not suitable for this VM (that do not have enough total memory/pCPUs) we are left with a monotonically increasing sequence of nodes.
There are still multiple possibilities with same average distance.
This is where we consider our second criteria - balancing - and pick the node with most available free memory.</p><p>Once a suitable set of NUMA nodes are picked we compute the CPU soft affinity as the union of the CPUs from all these NUMA nodes.
If we didn&rsquo;t find a solution then we let Xen use its default allocation.</p><p>The &ldquo;distances&rdquo; between NUMA nodes may not all be equal, e.g. some nodes may have shorter links to some remote NUMA nodes, while others may have to go through multiple hops to reach it.
See page 13 in <sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> for a diagram of an AMD Opteron 6272 system.</p><h2 id=limitations-and-tradeoffs>Limitations and tradeoffs</h2><ul><li>Booting multiple VMs in parallel will result in potentially allocating both on the same NUMA node (race condition)</li><li>When we&rsquo;re about to run out of host memory we&rsquo;ll fall back to striping memory again, but the soft affinity mask won&rsquo;t reflect that (this needs an API to query Xen on where it has actually placed the VM, so we can fix up the mask accordingly)</li><li>XAPI is not aware of NUMA balancing across a pool, and choses hosts purely based on total amount of free memory, even if a better NUMA placement could be found on another host</li><li>Very large (>16 NUMA nodes) systems may only explore a limited number of choices (fit into a single node vs fallback to full interleaving)</li><li>The exact VM placement is not yet controllable</li><li>Microbenchmarks with a single VM on a host show both performance improvements and regressions on memory bandwidth usage: previously a single VM may have been able to take advantage of the bandwidth of both NUMA nodes if it happened to allocate memory from the right places, whereas now it&rsquo;ll be forced to use just a single node.
As soon as you have more than 1 VM that is busy on a system enabling NUMA balancing should almost always be an improvement though.</li><li>it is not supported to combine hard vCPU masks with soft affinity: if hard affinities are used then no NUMA scheduling is done by the toolstack and we obey exactly what the user has asked for with hard affinities.
This shouldn&rsquo;t affect other VMs since the memory used by hard-pinned VMs will still be reflected in overall less memory available on individual NUMA nodes.</li><li>Corner case: the ACPI standard allows certain NUMA nodes to be unreachable (distance <code>0xFF</code> = <code>-1</code> in the Xen bindings).
This is not supported and will cause an exception to be raised.
If this is an issue in practice the NUMA matrix could be pre-filtered to contain only reachable nodes.
NUMA nodes with 0 CPUs <em>are</em> accepted (it can result from hard affinity pinnings)</li><li>NUMA balancing is not considered during HA planning</li><li>Dom0 is a single VM that needs to communicate with all other VMs, so NUMA balancing is not applied to it (we&rsquo;d need to expose NUMA topology to the Dom0 kernel so it can better allocate processes)</li><li>IO NUMA is out of scope for now</li></ul><h2 id=xapi-datamodel-design>XAPI datamodel design</h2><ul><li>New API field: <code>Host.numa_affinity_policy</code>.</li><li>Choices: <code>default_policy</code>, <code>any</code>, <code>best_effort</code>.</li><li>On upgrade the field is set to <code>default_policy</code></li><li>Changes in the field only affect newly (re)booted VMs, for changes to take effect on existing VMs a host evacuation or reboot is needed</li></ul><p>There may be more choices in the future (e.g. <code>strict</code>, which requires both Xen and toolstack changes).</p><p>Meaning of the policy:</p><ul><li><p><code>any</code>: the Xen default where it allocated memory by striping across NUMA nodes</p></li><li><p><code>best_effort</code>: the algorithm described in this document, where soft pinning is used to achieve better balancing and lower latency</p></li><li><p><code>default_policy</code>: when the admin hasn&rsquo;t expressed a preference</p></li><li><p>Currently <code>default_policy</code> is treated as <code>any</code>, but the admin can change it, and then the system will remember that change across upgrades.
If we didn&rsquo;t have a <code>default_policy</code> then changing the &ldquo;default&rdquo; policy on an upgrade would be tricky: we either risk overriding an explicit choice of the admin, or existing installs cannot take advantage of the improved performance from <code>best_effort</code></p></li><li><p>Future XAPI versions may change <code>default_policy</code> to mean <code>best_effort</code>.
Admins can still override it to <code>any</code> if they wish on a host by host basis.</p></li></ul><p>It is not expected that users would have to change <code>best_effort</code>, unless they run very specific workloads, so a pool level control is not provided at this moment.</p><p>There is also no separate feature flag: this host flag acts as a feature flag that can be set through the API without restarting the toolstack.
Although obviously only new VMs will benefit.</p><p>Debugging the allocator is done by running <code>xl vcpu-list</code> and investigating the soft pinning masks, and by analyzing xensource.log.</p><h3 id=xenopsd-implementation>Xenopsd implementation</h3><p>See the documentation in [softaffinity.mli] and [topology.mli].</p><ul><li>[Softaffinity.plan] returns a [CPUSet] given a host&rsquo;s NUMA allocation state and a VM&rsquo;s NUMA allocation request.</li><li>[Topology.CPUSet] provides helpers for operating on a set of CPU indexes.</li><li>[Topology.NUMAResource] is a [CPUSet] and the free memory available on a NUMA node.</li><li>[Topology.NUMARequest] is a request for a given number of vCPUs and memory in bytes.</li><li>[Topology.NUMA] represents a host&rsquo;s NUMA allocation state.</li><li>[Topology.NUMA.candidates] are groups of nodes orderd by minimum average distance.
