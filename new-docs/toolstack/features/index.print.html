or asynchronously: the admin&rsquo;s choice) between the primary and the secondary
site. When DR is enabled the VM disk data and VM metadata are written to the
storage server and mirrored. The secondary site contains the other side
of the data mirror and a set of hosts, which may be powered off.</p><p>In normal operation, the DR feature allows a &ldquo;dry-run&rdquo; recovery where a host
on the secondary site checks that it can indeed see all the VM disk data
and metadata. This should be done regularly, so that admins are familiar with
the process.</p><p>After a disaster, the admin breaks the mirror on the secondary site and triggers
a remote power-on of the offline hosts (either using an out-of-band tool or
the built-in host power-on feature of xapi). The pool master on the secondary
site can connect to the storage and extract all the VM metadata. Finally the
VMs can all be restarted.</p><p>When the primary site is fully recovered, the mirror can be re-synchronised
and the VMs can be moved back.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=event-handling-in-the-control-plane---xapi-xenopsd-and-xenstore>Event handling in the Control Plane - Xapi, Xenopsd and Xenstore</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Xapi, xenopsd and xenstore use a number of different events to obtain
indications that some state changed in dom0 or in the guests. The events
are used as an efficient alternative to polling all these states
periodically.</p><ul><li><strong>xenstore</strong> provides a very configurable approach in which each and
any key can be watched individually by a xenstore client. Once the
value of a watched key changes, xenstore will indicate to the client
that the value for that key has changed. An ocaml xenstore client
library provides a way for ocaml programs such as xenopsd,
message-cli and rrdd to provide high-level ocaml callback functions
to watch specific key. It&rsquo;s very common, for instance, for xenopsd
to watch specific keys in the xenstore keyspace of a guest and then
after receiving events for some or all of them, read other keys or
subkeys in xenstored to update its internal state mirroring the
state of guests and its devices (for instance, if the guest has pv
drivers and specific frontend devices have established connections
with the backend devices in dom0).</li><li><strong>xapi</strong> also provides a very configurable event mechanism in which
the xenapi can be used to provide events whenever a xapi object (for
instance, a VM, a VBD etc) changes state. This event mechanism is
very reliable and is extensively used by XenCenter to provide
real-time update on the XenCenter GUI.</li><li><strong>xenopsd</strong> provides a somewhat less configurable event mechanism,
where it always provides signals for all objects (VBDs, VMs
etc) whose state changed (so it&rsquo;s not possible to select a subset of
objects to watch for as in xenstore or in xapi). It&rsquo;s up to the
xenopsd client (eg. xapi) to receive these events and then filter
out or act on each received signal by calling back xenopsd and
asking it information for the specific signalled object.  The main
use in xapi for the xenopsd signals is to update xapi&rsquo;s database of
the current state of each object controlled by xenopsd (VBDs,
VMs etc).</li></ul><p>Given a choice between polling states and receiving events when the
state change, we should in general opt for receiving events in the code
in order to avoid adding bottlenecks in dom0 that will prevent the
scalability of XenServer to many VMs and virtual devices.</p><p><a href=#image-4f6014c78dbdb97f8a7d94504071f418 class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/toolstack/features/events/xapi-xenopsd-events.png alt="Connection of events between XAPI, xenopsd and xenstore, with main functions and data structures responsible for receiving and sending them" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

xapi_xenops.events_watch() in its own independent thread. This is a
single-threaded function that is responsible for handling all of the
signals sent by xenopsd. In some situations with lots of VMs and virtual
devices such as VBDs, this loop may saturate a single dom0 vcpu, which
will slow down handling all of the xenopsd events and may cause the
xenopsd signals to accumulate unboundedly in the worst case in the
updates queue in xenopsd (see Figure 1).</p><p>The function xapi_xenops.events_watch() calls
xenops_client.UPDATES.get() to obtain a list of (barrier, 
barrier_events), and then it process each one of the barrier_event,
which can be one of the following events:</p><ul><li><strong>Vm id:</strong> something changed in this VM,
run xapi_xenops.update_vm() to query xenopsd about its state. The
function update_vm() will update power_state, allowed_operations,
console and guest_agent state in the xapi DB.</li><li><strong>Vbd id:</strong> something changed in this VM,
run xapi_xenops.update_vbd() to query xenopsd about its state. The
function update_vbd() will update currently_attached and connected
in the xapi DB.</li><li><strong>Vif id:</strong> something changed in this VM,
run xapi_xenops.update_vif() to query xenopsd about its state. The
function update_vif() will update activate and plugged state of in
the xapi DB.</li><li><strong>Pci id:</strong> something changed in this VM,
run xapi_xenops.update_pci() to query xenopsd about its state.</li><li><strong>Vgpu id:</strong> something changed in this VM,
run xapi_xenops.update_vgpu() to query xenopsd about its state.</li><li><strong>Task id:</strong> something changed in this VM,
run xapi_xenops.update_task() to query xenopsd about its state.
The function update_task() will update the progress of the task in
the xapi DB using the information of the task in xenopsd.</li></ul><p><a href=#image-31a4d1ce6cdaad3cfe2df6025cefbf2b class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/toolstack/features/events/receiving-events-from-xenopsd.png alt="Receiving events from xenopsd" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

xapi_xenops.events_watch():</p><ul><li>if an event X=(vm_id,dev_id) (eg. Vbd dev_id) has already been
processed in a barrier_events, it&rsquo;s not processed again. A typical
value for X is eg. &ldquo;&lt;vm_uuid>.xvda&rdquo; for a VBD.</li><li>if Events_from_xenopsd.are_supressed X, then this event
is ignored. Events are supressed if VM X.vm_id is migrating away
from the host</li></ul><h4 id=barriers>Barriers</h4><p>When xapi needs to execute (and to wait for events indicating completion
of) a xapi operation (such as VM.start and VM.shutdown) containing many
xenopsd sub-operations (such as VM.start – to force xenopsd to change
the VM power_state, and VM.stat, VBD.stat, VIF.stat etc – to force the
xapi DB to catch up with the xenopsd new state for these objects), xapi
sends to the xenopsd input queue a barrier, indicating that xapi will
then block and only continue execution of the barred operation when
xenopsd returns the barrier. The barrier should only be returned when
xenopsd has finished the execution of all the operations requested by
xapi (such as VBD.stat and VM.stat in order to update the state of the
VM in the xapi database after a VM.start has been issued to xenopsd). </p><p>A recent problem has been detected in the xapi_xenops.events_watch() 
function: when it needs to process many VM_check_state events, this
may push for later the processing of barriers associated with a
VM.start, delaying xapi in reporting (via a xapi event) that the VM
state in the xapi DB has reached the running power_state. This needs
further debugging, and is probably one of the reasons in CA-87377 why in
some conditions a xapi event reporting that the VM power_state is
running (causing it to go from yellow to green state in XenCenter) is
taking so long to be returned, way after the VM is already running.</p><h2 id=xenopsd>Xenopsd</h2><p>Xenopsd has a few queues that are used by xapi to store commands to be
executed (eg. VBD.stat) and update events to be picked up by xapi. The

states of these objects have changed (perhaps because either a guest or
the dom0 backend changed the state of a virtual device), it creates a
signal for the corresponding object (VM_check_state, VBD_check_state
etc) and send it up to xapi. Xapi will then process this event in its
xapi_xenops.events_watch() function.</p><p><a href=#image-2142e44ae2c3862e36855ce43ca4ae28 class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/toolstack/features/events/sending-events-to-xapi.png alt="Sending events to xapi" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

single-threaded xapi_xenops.events_watch() function is having
difficulties (ie taking a long time) to process previous signals in the
UPDATES queue from xenopsd.  </p><h3 id=receiving-events-from-xenstore>Receiving events from xenstore</h3><p>Xenopsd watches a number of keys in xenstore, both in dom0 and in each
guest. Xenstore is responsible to send watch events to xenopsd whenever
the watched keys change state. Xenopsd uses a xenstore client library to
make it easier to create a callback function that is called whenever
xenstore sends these events.</p><p><a href=#image-74c8f75c8cf45fa63b2f9492c24c1481 class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/toolstack/features/events/receiving-events-from-xenstore.png alt="Receiving events from xenstore" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

polling of some values. An example is the @introduceDomain event in
xenstore (handled in xenopsd/xc/xenstore_watch.ml), which indicates
that a new VM has been created. This event unfortunately does not
indicate the domid of the VM, and xenopsd needs to query Xen (via libxc)
which domains are now available in the host and compare with the
previous list of known domains, in order to figure out the domid of the
newly introduced domain.</p><p> It is not good practice to poll xenstore for changes of values. This
will add a large overhead to both xenstore and xenopsd, and decrease the
scalability of XenServer in terms of number of VMs/host and virtual
devices per VM. A much better approach is to rely on the watch events of
xenstore to indicate when a specific value has changed in xenstore.</p><h2 id=xenstore>Xenstore</h2><h3 id=sending-events-to-xenstore-clients>Sending events to xenstore clients</h3><p>If a xenstore client has created watch events for a key, then xenstore

holds the VM and disk locks.</li><li>there must be at most one instance of a particular VM at all times. This

corruption.</li></ol><p>However to be useful HA must:</p><ul><li>detect failures quickly;</li><li>minimise the number of false-positives in the failure detector; and</li><li>make the failure handling logic as robust as possible.</li></ul><p>The implementation difficulty arises when trying to be both useful and safe
at the same time.</p><h2 id=terminology>Terminology</h2><p>We use the following terminology:</p><ul><li><em>fencing</em>: also known as I/O fencing, refers to the act of isolating a
host from network and storage. Once a host has been fenced, any VMs running
there cannot generate side-effects observable to a third party. This means
it is safe to restart the running VMs on another node without violating the
safety-rule and running the same VM simultaneously in two locations.</li><li><em>heartbeating</em>: exchanging status updates with other hosts at regular
pre-arranged intervals. Heartbeat messages reveal that hosts are alive
and that I/O paths are working.</li><li><em>statefile</em>: a shared disk (also known as a &ldquo;quorum disk&rdquo;) on the &ldquo;Heartbeat&rdquo;
SR which is mapped as a block device into every host&rsquo;s domain 0. The shared
disk acts both as a channel for heartbeat messages and also as a building
block of a Pool master lock, to prevent multiple hosts becoming masters in
violation of the safety-rule (a dangerous situation also known as
&ldquo;split-brain&rdquo;).</li><li><em>management network</em>: the network over which the XenAPI XML/RPC requests
flow and also used to send heartbeat messages.</li><li><em>liveset</em>: a per-Host view containing a subset of the Hosts in the Pool
which are considered by that Host to be alive i.e. responding to XenAPI
commands and running the VMs marked as <code>resident_on</code> there. When a Host <code>b</code>
leaves the liveset as seen by Host <code>a</code> it is safe for Host <code>a</code> to assume
that Host <code>b</code> has been fenced and to take recovery actions (e.g. restarting
VMs), without violating either of the safety-rules.</li><li><em>properly shared SR</em>: an SR which has field <code>shared=true</code>; and which has a
<code>PBD</code> connecting it to every <code>enabled</code> Host in the Pool; and where each of
these <code>PBD</code>s has field <code>currently_attached</code> set to true. A VM whose disks
are in a properly shared SR could be restarted on any <code>enabled</code> Host,
memory and network permitting.</li><li><em>properly shared Network</em>: a Network which has a <code>PIF</code> connecting it to
every <code>enabled</code> Host in the Pool; and where each of these <code>PIF</code>s has
field <code>currently_attached</code> set to true. A VM whose VIFs connect to
properly shared Networks could be restarted on any <code>enabled</code> Host,
memory and storage permitting.</li><li><em>agile</em>: a VM is said to be agile if all disks are in properly shared SRs
and all network interfaces connect to properly shared Networks.</li><li><em>unprotected</em>: an unprotected VM has field <code>ha_always_run</code> set to false
and will never be restarted automatically on failure
or have reconfiguration actions blocked by the HA overcommit protection.</li><li><em>best-effort</em>: a best-effort VM has fields <code>ha_always_run</code> set to true and
<code>ha_restart_priority</code> set to best-effort.
A best-effort VM will only be restarted if (i) the failure is directly
observed; and (ii) capacity exists for an immediate restart.
No more than one restart attempt will ever be made.</li><li><em>protected</em>: a VM is said to be protected if it will be restarted by HA
i.e. has field <code>ha_always_run</code> set to true and
field <code>ha_restart_priority</code> not set to `best-effort.</li><li><em>survival rule 1</em>: describes the situation where hosts survive
because they are in the largest network partition with statefile access.
This is the normal state of the <code>xhad</code> daemon.</li><li><em>survival rule 2</em>: describes the situation where <em>all</em> hosts have lost
access to the statefile but remain alive
while they can all see each-other on the network. In this state any further
failure will cause all nodes to self-fence.
This state is intended to cope with the system-wide temporary loss of the
storage service underlying the statefile.</li></ul><h2 id=assumptions>Assumptions</h2><p>We assume:</p><ul><li>All I/O used for monitoring the health of hosts (i.e. both storage and
network-based heartbeating) is along redundant paths, so that it survives
a single hardware failure (e.g. a broken switch or an accidentally-unplugged
cable). It is up to the admin to ensure their environment is setup correctly.</li><li>The hypervisor watchdog mechanism will be able to guarantee the isolation
of nodes, once communication has been lost, within a pre-arranged time
period. Therefore no active power fencing equipment is required.</li><li>VMs may only be marked as <em>protected</em> if they are fully <em>agile</em> i.e. able
to run on any host, memory permitting. No additional constraints of any kind
may be specified e.g. it is not possible to make &ldquo;CPU reservations&rdquo;.</li><li>Pools are assumed to be homogenous with respect to CPU type and presence of
VT/SVM support (also known as &ldquo;HVM&rdquo;). If a Pool is created with
non-homogenous hosts using the <code>--force</code> flag then the additional
constraints will not be noticed by the VM failover planner resulting in
runtime failures while trying to execute the failover plans.</li><li>No attempt will ever be made to shutdown or suspend &ldquo;lower&rdquo; priority VMs
to guarantee the survival of &ldquo;higher&rdquo; priority VMs.</li><li>Once HA is enabled it is not possible to reconfigure the management network
or the SR used for storage heartbeating.</li><li>VMs marked as <em>protected</em> are considered to have failed if they are offline
i.e. the VM failure handling code is level-sensitive rather than
edge-sensitive.</li><li>VMs marked as <em>best-effort</em> are considered to have failed only when the host
where they are resident is declared offline
i.e. the best-effort VM failure handling code is edge-sensitive rather than
level-sensitive.
A single restart attempt is attempted and if this fails no further start is
attempted.</li><li>HA can only be enabled if all Pool hosts are online and actively responding
to requests.</li><li>when HA is enabled the database is configured to write all updates to
the &ldquo;Heartbeat&rdquo; SR, guaranteeing that VM configuration changes are not lost
when a host fails.</li></ul><h2 id=components>Components</h2><p>The implementation is split across the following components:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/xenserver/xha target=_blank>xhad</a>: the cluster membership daemon
maintains a quorum of hosts through network and storage heartbeats</li><li><a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api target=_blank>xapi</a>: used to configure the
HA policy i.e. which network and storage to use for heartbeating and which
VMs to restart after a failure.</li><li><a href=http://xenproject.org/ target=_blank>xen</a>: the Xen watchdog is used to reliably
fence the host when the host has been (partially or totally) isolated
from the cluster</li></ul><p>To avoid a &ldquo;split-brain&rdquo;, the cluster membership daemon must &ldquo;fence&rdquo; (i.e.
isolate) nodes when they are not part of the cluster. In general there are
2 approaches:</p><ul><li>cut the power of remote hosts which you can&rsquo;t talk to on the network
any more. This is the approach taken by most open-source clustering
software since it is simpler. However it has the downside of requiring
the customer buy more hardware and set it up correctly.</li><li>rely on the remote hosts using a watchdog to cut their own power (i.e.
halt or reboot) after a timeout. This relies on the watchdog being
reliable. Most other people <a href=https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle_ha/singlehtml/book_sleha/book_sleha.html target=_blank>don&rsquo;t trust the Linux watchdog</a>;
after all the Linux kernel is highly threaded, performs a lot of (useful)
functions and kernel bugs which result in deadlocks do happen.
We use the Xen watchdog because we believe that the Xen hypervisor is
simple enough to reliably fence the host (via triggering a reboot of
domain 0 which then triggers a host reboot).</li></ul><h1 id=xhad>xhad</h1><p><a href=https://github.com/xenserver/xha target=_blank>xhad</a> is the cluster membership daemon:
it exchanges heartbeats with the other nodes to determine which nodes are
still in the cluster (the &ldquo;live set&rdquo;) and which nodes have <em>definitely</em>
failed (through watchdog fencing). When a host has definitely failed, xapi
will unlock all the disks and restart the VMs according to the HA policy.</p><p>Since Xapi is a critical part of the system, the xhad also acts as a
Xapi watchdog. It polls Xapi every few seconds and checks if Xapi can
respond. If Xapi seems to have failed then xhad will restart it. If restarts
continue to fail then xhad will consider the host to have failed and
self-fence.</p><p>xhad is configured via a simple config file written on each host in
<code>/etc/xensource/xhad.conf</code>. The file must be identical on each host
in the cluster. To make changes to the file, HA must be disabled and then
re-enabled afterwards. Note it may not be possible to re-enable HA depending
on the configuration change (e.g. if a host has been added but that host has
a broken network configuration then this will block HA enable).</p><p>The xhad.conf file is written in XML and contains</p><ul><li>pool-wide configuration: this includes a list of all hosts which should
be in the liveset and global timeout information</li><li>local host configuration: this identifies the local host and described
which local network interface and block device to use for heartbeating.</li></ul><p>The following is an example xhad.conf file:</p><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e>&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;utf-8&#34;?&gt;</span>

to allow this traffic through the firewall and to make sure the same

set this to <code>T</code>.</li><li>StateFileWatchdogTimeout: If the host does not update the statefile for
this amount of time then the host self-fences via the Xen watchdog. We
normally set this to <code>T+15</code>.</li><li>BootJoinTimeout: When the host is booting and joining the liveset (i.e.

check to complete before concluding that xhad should terminate.</li></ul><p>In addition to the config file, Xhad exposes a simple control API which
is exposed as scripts:</p><ul><li><code>ha_set_pool_state (Init | Invalid)</code>: sets the global pool state to &ldquo;Init&rdquo; (before starting
HA) or &ldquo;Invalid&rdquo; (causing all other daemons who can see the statefile to
shutdown)</li><li><code>ha_start_daemon</code>: if the pool state is &ldquo;Init&rdquo; then the daemon will
attempt to contact other daemons and enable HA. If the pool state is
&ldquo;Active&rdquo; then the host will attempt to join the existing liveset.</li><li><code>ha_query_liveset</code>: returns the current state of the cluster.</li><li><code>ha_propose_master</code>: returns whether the current node has been
elected pool master.</li><li><code>ha_stop_daemon</code>: shuts down the xhad on the local host. Note this
will not disarm the Xen watchdog by itself.</li><li><code>ha_disarm_fencing</code>: disables fencing on the local host.</li><li><code>ha_set_excluded</code>: when a host is being shutdown cleanly, record the
fact that the VMs have all been shutdown so that this host can be ignored
in future cluster membership calculations.</li></ul><h2 id=fencing>Fencing</h2><p>Xhad continuously monitors whether the host should remain alive, or if
it should self-fence. There are two &ldquo;survival rules&rdquo; which will keep a host
alive; if neither rule applies (or if xhad crashes or deadlocks) then the
host will fence. The rules are:</p><ol><li>Xapi is running; the storage heartbeats are visible; this host is a
member of the &ldquo;best&rdquo; partition (as seen through the storage heartbeats)</li><li>Xapi is running; the storage is inaccessible; all hosts which should
be running (i.e. not those &ldquo;excluded&rdquo; by being cleanly shutdown) are
online and have also lost storage access (as seen through the network
heartbeats).</li></ol><p>where the &ldquo;best&rdquo; partition is the largest one if that is unique, or if there
are multiple partitions of the same size then the one containing the lowest
host uuid is considered best.</p><p>The first survival rule is the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; case. The second rule exists only
to prevent the storage from becoming a single point of failure: all hosts
can remain alive until the storage is repaired. Note that if a host has
failed and has not yet been repaired, then the storage becomes a single
point of failure for the degraded pool. HA removes single point of failures,
but multiple failures can still cause problems. It is important to fix
failures properly after HA has worked around them.</p><h1 id=xapi>xapi</h1><p><a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api target=_blank>Xapi</a> is responsible for</p><ul><li>exposing an interface for setting HA policy</li><li>creating VDIs (disks) on shared storage for heartbeating and storing
the pool database</li><li>arranging for these disks to be attached on host boot, before the &ldquo;SRmaster&rdquo;
is online</li><li>configuring and managing the <code>xhad</code> heartbeating daemon</li></ul><p>The HA policy APIs include</p><ul><li>methods to determine whether a VM is <em>agile</em> i.e. can be restarted in
principle on any host after a failure</li><li>planning for a user-specified number of host failures and enforcing
access control</li><li>restarting failed <em>protected</em> VMs in policy order</li></ul><p>The HA policy settings are stored in the Pool database which is written
(synchronously)
to a VDI in the same SR that&rsquo;s being used for heartbeating. This ensures
that the database can be recovered after a host fails and the VMs are
recovered.</p><p>Xapi stores 2 settings in its local database:</p><ul><li><em>ha_disable_failover_actions</em>: this is set to false when we want nodes
to be able to recover VMs &ndash; this is the normal case. It is set to true
during the HA disable process to prevent a split-brain forming while
HA is only partially enabled.</li><li><em>ha_armed</em>: this is set to true to tell Xapi to start <code>Xhad</code> during
host startup and wait to join the liveset.</li></ul><h2 id=disks-on-shared-storage>Disks on shared storage</h2><p>The regular disk APIs for creating, destroying, attaching, detaching (etc)
disks need the <code>SRmaster</code> (usually but not always the Pool master) to be
online to allow the disks to be locked. The <code>SRmaster</code> cannot be brought
online until the host has joined the liveset. Therefore we have a
cyclic dependency: joining the liveset needs the statefile disk to be attached
but attaching a disk requires being a member of the liveset already.</p><p>The dependency is broken by adding an explicit &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; attach storage
API called <code>VDI_ATTACH_FROM_CONFIG</code>. Xapi uses the <code>VDI_GENERATE_CONFIG</code> API
during the HA enable operation and stores away the result. When the system
boots the <code>VDI_ATTACH_FROM_CONFIG</code> is able to attach the disk without the
SRmaster.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-hostenabled>The role of Host.enabled</h2><p>The <code>Host.enabled</code> flag is used to mean, &ldquo;this host is ready to start VMs and
should be included in failure planning&rdquo;.
The VM restart planner assumes for simplicity that all <em>protected</em> VMs can
be started anywhere; therefore all involved networks and storage must be
<em>properly shared</em>.
If a host with an unplugged <code>PBD</code> were to become enabled then the corresponding
<code>SR</code> would cease to be <em>properly shared</em>, all the VMs would cease to be
<em>agile</em> and the VM restart logic would fail.</p><p>To ensure the VM restart logic always works, great care is taken to make
sure that Hosts may only become enabled when their networks and storage are
properly configured. This is achieved by:</p><ul><li>when the master boots and initialises its database it sets all Hosts to
dead and disabled and then signals the HA background thread
(<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/0bbd4f5ac5fe46f9e982e5d5587ac56ed8427295/ocaml/xapi/xapi_ha.ml#L627 target=_blank>signal_database_state_valid</a>)
to wake up from sleep and
start processing liveset information (and potentially setting hosts to live)</li><li>when a slave calls

(i.e. after the slave has rebooted),
the master sets it to disabled, allowing it a grace period to plug in its
storage;</li><li>when a host (master or slave) successfully plugs in its networking and
storage it calls
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/0bbd4f5ac5fe46f9e982e5d5587ac56ed8427295/ocaml/xapi/xapi_host_helpers.ml#L193 target=_blank>consider_enabling_host</a>
which checks that the
preconditions are met and then sets the host to enabled; and</li><li>when a slave notices its database connection to the master restart
(i.e. after the master <code>xapi</code> has just restarted) it calls
<code>consider_enabling_host}</code></li></ul><h2 id=the-steady-state>The steady-state</h2><p>When HA is enabled and all hosts are running normally then each calls
<code>ha_query_liveset</code> every 10s.</p><p>Slaves check to see if the host they believe is the master is alive and has
the master lock. If another node has become master then the slave will
rewrite its <code>pool.conf</code> and restart. If no node is the master then the
slave will call
<a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/0bbd4f5ac5fe46f9e982e5d5587ac56ed8427295/ocaml/xapi/xapi_ha.ml#L129 target=_blank>on_master_failure</a>,
proposing itself and, if it is rejected,
checking the liveset to see which node acquired the lock.</p><p>The master monitors the liveset and updates the <code>Host_metrics.live</code> flag
of every host to reflect the liveset value. For every host which is not in
the liveset (i.e. has fenced) it enumerates all resident VMs and marks them
as <code>Halted</code>. For each protected VM which is not running, the master computes
a VM restart plan and attempts to execute it. If the plan fails then a
best-effort <code>VM.start</code> call is attempted. Finally an alert is generated if
the VM could not be restarted.</p><p>Note that XenAPI heartbeats are still sent when HA is enabled, even though
they are not used to drive the values of the <code>Host_metrics.live</code> field.
Note further that, when a host is being shutdown, the host is immediately
marked as dead and its host reference is added to a list used to prevent the
<code>Host_metrics.live</code> being accidentally reset back to live again by the
asynchronous liveset query. The Host reference is removed from the list when
the host restarts and calls <code>Pool.hello</code>.</p><h2 id=planning-and-overcommit>Planning and overcommit</h2><p>The VM failover planning code is sub-divided into two pieces, stored in

algorithmm is used for smaller/less
complicated pool configurations while the less detailed, cheaper algorithm
is used for the rest. The
choice between algorithms is based only on <code>total_hosts</code> (<code>n</code>) and
<code>num_failures</code> (<code>r</code>).
Note that the choice of algorithm will only change if the number of Pool
hosts is varied (requiring HA to be disabled and then enabled) or if the
user requests a new <code>num_failures</code> target to plan for.</p><p>The expensive algorithm uses an exchaustive search with a
&ldquo;biggest-fit-decreasing&rdquo; strategy that
takes the biggest VMs first and allocates them to the biggest remaining Host.
The implementation keeps the VMs and Hosts as sorted lists throughout.
There are a number of transformations to the input configuration which are
guaranteed to preserve the existence of a VM to host allocation (even if
the actual allocation is different). These transformations which are safe
are:</p><ul><li>VMs may be removed from the list</li><li>VMs may have their memory requirements reduced</li><li>Hosts may be added</li><li>Hosts may have additional memory added.</li></ul><p>The cheaper algorithm is used for larger Pools where the state space to
search is too large. It uses the same &ldquo;biggest-fit-decreasing&rdquo; strategy
with the following simplifying approximations:</p><ul><li>every VM that fails is as big as the biggest</li><li>the number of VMs which fail due to a single Host failure is always the
maximum possible (even if these are all very small VMs)</li><li>the largest and most capable Hosts fail</li></ul><p>An informal argument that these approximations are safe is as follows:
if the maximum <em>number</em> of VMs fail, each of which is size of the largest
and we can find a restart plan using only the smaller hosts then any real
failure:</p><ul><li>can never result in the failure of more VMs;</li><li>can never result in the failure of bigger VMs; and</li><li>can never result in less host capacity remaining.</li></ul><p>Therefore we can take this <em>almost-certainly-worse-than-worst-case</em> failure
plan and:</p><ul><li>replace the remaining hosts in the worst case plan with the real remaining
hosts, which will be the same size or larger; and</li><li>replace the failed VMs in the worst case plan with the real failed VMs,
which will be fewer or the same in number and smaller or the same in size.</li></ul><p>Note that this strategy will perform best when each host has the same number
of VMs on it and when all VMs are approximately the same size. If one very big
VM exists and a lot of smaller VMs then it will probably fail to find a plan.
It is more tolerant of differing amounts of free host memory.</p><h2 id=overcommit-protection>Overcommit protection</h2><p>Overcommit protection blocks operations which would prevent the Pool being
able to restart <em>protected</em> VMs after host failure.
The Pool may become unable to restart protected VMs in two general ways:
(i) by running out of resource i.e. host memory; and (ii) by altering host
configuration in such a way that VMs cannot be started (or the planner
thinks that VMs cannot be started).</p><p>API calls which would change the amount of host memory currently in use

from the pool such that a future failure of the storage heartbeat will
not cause all pool hosts to self-fence (see survival rule 2 above).
When a host is &ldquo;excluded&rdquo; all other hosts know that the host does not
consider itself a master and has no resources locked i.e. no VMs are
running on it. An excluded host will never allow itself to form part
of a &ldquo;split brain&rdquo;.</p><p>Once a host has given up its master role and shutdown any VMs, it is safe
to disable fencing with <code>ha_disarm_fencing</code> and stop xhad with
<code>ha_stop_daemon</code>. Once the daemon has been stopped the &ldquo;excluded&rdquo;
bit can be set in the statefile via <code>ha_set_excluded</code> and the
host safely rebooted.</p><h2 id=restarting-a-host>Restarting a host</h2><p>When a host restarts after a failure Xapi notices that <em>ha_armed</em> is

be recovered, there is an emergency HA disable API the admin can use to
assert that HA really has been disabled, and it&rsquo;s not simply a connectivity
problem. Obviously this API should only be used if the admin is totally
sure that HA has been disabled.</p><h2 id=disabling-ha>Disabling HA</h2><p>There are 2 methods of disabling HA: one for the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; case when the

are alive because of survival rule 1. First the master Xapi tells the local
Xhad to mark the pool state as &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; using <code>ha_set_pool_state</code>.
Every xhad instance will notice this state change the next time it performs
a storage heartbeat. The Xhad instances will shutdown and Xapi will notice
that HA has been disabled the next time it attempts to query the liveset.</p><p>If a host loses access to the statefile (or if none of the hosts have
access to the statefile) then HA can be disabled uncleanly.</p><h2 id=disabling-ha-uncleanly>Disabling HA uncleanly</h2><p>The Xapi master first calls <code>Host.ha_disable_failover_actions</code> on each host

master lock and restarting VMs when other hosts have disabled their

However migration introduces additional delays and is best avoided for entire VMs.</p><p>The latter (soft pinning) is preferred: running a workload now, even on a potentially suboptimal pCPU (higher NUMA latency) is still better than not running it at all and waiting until a pCPU is freed up.</p><p>Xen will also allocate memory for the VM according to the vCPU (soft) pinning: if the vCPUs are pinned only to NUMA nodes A and B, then it will allocate the VM&rsquo;s memory from NUMA nodes A and B (in a round-robin way, resulting in interleaving).</p><p>By default (no pinning) it will interleave memory from all NUMA nodes, which provides average performance, but individual tasks&rsquo; performance may be significantly higher or lower depending on which NUMA node the application may have &ldquo;landed&rdquo; on.
Furthermore restarting processes will speed them up or slow them down as address space randomization picks different memory regions inside a VM.</p><p>Note that this is not the worst case: the worst case would be for memory to be allocated on one NUMA node, but the vCPU always running on the furthest away NUMA node.</p><h2 id=best-effort-numa-aware-memory-allocation-for-vms>Best effort NUMA-aware memory allocation for VMs</h2><p>By default Xen stripes the VM&rsquo;s memory accross all NUMA nodes of the host, which means that every VM has to go through all the interconnects.
The goal here is to find a better allocation than the default, not necessarily an optimal allocation.
An optimal allocation would require knowing what VMs you would start/create in the future, and planning across hosts too.</p><p>Overall we want to balance the VMs across NUMA nodes, such that we use all NUMA nodes to take advantage of the maximum memory bandwidth available on the system.
For now this proposed balancing will be done only by balancing memory usage: always heuristically allocating VMs on the NUMA node that has the most available memory.
Note that this allocation has a race condition for now when multiple VMs are booted in parallel, because we don&rsquo;t wait until Xen has constructed the domain for each one (that&rsquo;d serialize domain construction, which is currently parallel).
This may be improved in the future by having an API to query Xen where it has allocated the memory, and to explicitly ask it to place memory on a given NUMA node (instead of best_effort).</p><p>If a VM doesn&rsquo;t fit into a single node then it is not so clear what the best approach is.
One criteria to consider is minimizing the NUMA distance between the nodes chosen for the VM.
Large NUMA systems may not be fully connected in a mesh requiring multiple hops to each a node, or even have assymetric links, or links with different bitwidth.
These tradeoff should be approximatively reflected in the ACPI SLIT tables, as a matrix of distances between nodes.
It is possible that 3 NUMA nodes have a smaller average/maximum distance than 2, so we need to consider all possibilities.</p><p>For N nodes there would be 2^N possibilities, so [Topology.NUMA.candidates] limits the number of choices to 65520+N (full set of 2^N possibilities for 16 NUMA nodes, and a reduced set of choices for larger systems).</p><p>[Topology.NUMA.candidates] is a sorted sequence of node sets, in ascending order of maximum/average distances.
Once we&rsquo;ve eliminated the candidates not suitable for this VM (that do not have enough total memory/pCPUs) we are left with a monotonically increasing sequence of nodes.
There are still multiple possibilities with same average distance.
This is where we consider our second criteria - balancing - and pick the node with most available free memory.</p><p>Once a suitable set of NUMA nodes are picked we compute the CPU soft affinity as the union of the CPUs from all these NUMA nodes.
If we didn&rsquo;t find a solution then we let Xen use its default allocation.</p><p>The &ldquo;distances&rdquo; between NUMA nodes may not all be equal, e.g. some nodes may have shorter links to some remote NUMA nodes, while others may have to go through multiple hops to reach it.

As soon as you have more than 1 VM that is busy on a system enabling NUMA balancing should almost always be an improvement though.</li><li>it is not supported to combine hard vCPU masks with soft affinity: if hard affinities are used then no NUMA scheduling is done by the toolstack and we obey exactly what the user has asked for with hard affinities.
This shouldn&rsquo;t affect other VMs since the memory used by hard-pinned VMs will still be reflected in overall less memory available on individual NUMA nodes.</li><li>Corner case: the ACPI standard allows certain NUMA nodes to be unreachable (distance <code>0xFF</code> = <code>-1</code> in the Xen bindings).
This is not supported and will cause an exception to be raised.

blocks from a large shared copy-on-write pool with support for dedup.</p><h1 id=reverting-disk-snapshots>Reverting disk snapshots</h1><p>There is no current way to revert in-place a disk to a snapshot, but it is
possible to create a writable disk by &ldquo;cloning&rdquo; a snapshot.</p><h1 id=vm-snapshots>VM snapshots</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s say we have a VM, &ldquo;VM1&rdquo; that has 2 disks. Concentrating only
on the VM, VBDs and VDIs, we have the following structure:</p><p><a href=#image-720964ddd08ca998944c68c43e6f216f class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/toolstack/features/snapshots/vm.png alt="VM objects" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

all of the VDIs associated with the VM, producing new VDI objects.
Then we copy all of the metadata, producing a new &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; VM
object, complete with its own VBDs copied from the original, but now
pointing at the snapshot VDIs. We also copy the VIFs and VGPUs
but for now we will ignore those.</p><p>This process leads to a set of objects that look like this:</p><p><a href=#image-6cc8559bae390d79fa5da9997226799c class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/toolstack/features/snapshots/vm-snapshot.png alt="VM and snapshot objects" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

and <code>VDI.snapshot_of</code>. These, like you would expect, point to the
relevant other objects.</p><h1 id=deleting-vm-snapshots>Deleting VM snapshots</h1><p>When a snapshot is deleted Xapi calls the SM API <code>vdi_delete</code>. The Xapi SM
plugins which use vhd format data do not reclaim space immediately; instead
they mark the corresponding vhd leaf node as &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; and, at some point later,
run a garbage collector process.</p><p>The garbage collector will first determine whether a &ldquo;coalesce&rdquo; should happen i.e.
whether any parent nodes have only one child i.e. the &ldquo;shared&rdquo; blocks are only
&ldquo;shared&rdquo; with one other node. In the following example the snapshot delete leaves
such a parent node and the coalesce process copies blocks from the redundant
parent&rsquo;s only child into the parent:</p><p><a href=#image-f4cebc570e5c865a7daa8236fe4ed970 class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/toolstack/features/snapshots/coalesce1.png alt="We coalesce parent blocks into grand parent nodes" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

have had to be expanded to full size to accommodate the writes. Unfortunately
this means the act of reclaiming space actually consumes space itself, which
means it is important to never completely run out of space in such an SR.</p><p>Once the blocks have been copied, we can now cut one of the parents out of the
tree by relinking its children into their grandparent:</p><p><a href=#image-ed9dd46bc4c358a335e3580f335d072d class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/toolstack/features/snapshots/coalesce2.png alt="Relink children into grand parent" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

metadata, deletes the current VDIs and replaces them with clones of the
snapshot VDIs. Note there is no &ldquo;vdi_revert&rdquo; in the SMAPI.</p><h2 id=revert-implementation-details>Revert implementation details</h2><p>This is the process by which we revert a VM to a snapshot. The
first thing to notice is that there is some logic that is called
from <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/ce6d3f276f0a56ef57ebcf10f45b0f478fd70322/ocaml/xapi/message_forwarding.ml#L1528 target=_blank>message_forwarding.ml</a>,
which uses some low-level database magic to turn the current VM
record into one that looks like the snapshot object. We then go
to the rest of the implementation in <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/ce6d3f276f0a56ef57ebcf10f45b0f478fd70322/ocaml/xapi/xapi_vm_snapshot.ml#L403 target=_blank>xapi_vm_snapshot.ml</a>.
First,
we shut down the VM if it is currently running. Then, we revert
all of the <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/ce6d3f276f0a56ef57ebcf10f45b0f478fd70322/ocaml/xapi/xapi_vm_snapshot.ml#L270 target=_blank>VBDs, VIFs and VGPUs</a>.
To revert the VBDs, we need to deal with the VDIs underneath them.
In order to create space, the first thing we do is <a href=https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/ce6d3f276f0a56ef57ebcf10f45b0f478fd70322/ocaml/xapi/xapi_vm_snapshot.ml#L287 target=_blank>delete all of
the VDIs</a> currently attached via VBDs to the VM.
We then <em>clone</em> the disks from the snapshot. Note that there is
no SMAPI operation &lsquo;revert&rsquo; currently - we simply clone from
the snapshot VDI. It&rsquo;s important to note that cloning
creates a <em>new</em> VDI object: this is not the one we started with gone.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=vgpu>vGPU</h1><p>XenServer has supported passthrough for GPU devices since XenServer 6.0. Since
the advent of NVIDIA&rsquo;s vGPU-capable GRID K1/K2 cards it has been possible to
carve up a GPU into smaller pieces yielding a more scalable solution to
boosting graphics performance within virtual machines.</p><p>The K1 has four GK104 GPUs and the K2 two GK107 GPUs. Each of these will be exposed through Xapi so a host with a single K1 card will have access to four independent PGPUs.</p><p>Each of the GPUs can then be subdivided into vGPUs. For each type of PGPU,
there are a few options of vGPU type which consume different amounts of the
PGPU. For example, K1 and K2 cards can currently be configured in the following
ways:</p><p><a href=#image-cbe4f7c28a62b95bb3ef6d385681fcf2 class=lightbox-link><img src=/new-docs/toolstack/features/VGPU/vgx-configs.png alt="Possible VGX configurations" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style=height:auto;width:auto loading=lazy></a>

configurations</em> but different configurations are supported on different PGPUs
across a single K1/K2 card. This means that, for example, a host with a K1 card
can run 64 VMs with k100 vGPUs (8 per PGPU).</p><h2 id=xenservers-vgpu-architecture>XenServer&rsquo;s vGPU architecture</h2><p>A new display type has been added to the device model:</p><div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-udiff data-lang=udiff><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e>@@ -4519,6 +4522,7 @@ static const QEMUOption qemu_options[] =

synonymous with GPU-passthrough. A VGPU is simply a display device assigned to
a VM which may be a vGPU (this feature) or a whole GPU (a VGPU of type
<em>passthrough</em>).</p><p><strong><code>VGPU_types</code></strong> can be enabled/disabled on a <strong>per-PGPU basis</strong> allowing for
reservation of particular PGPUs for certain workloads. VGPUs are allocated on
PGPUs within their GPU group in either a <em>depth-first</em> or <em>breadth-first</em>
manner, which is configurable on a per-group basis.</p><p><strong><code>VGPU_types</code></strong> are created by xapi at startup depending on the available
hardware and config files present in dom0. They exist in the pool database, and
a primary key is used to avoid duplication. In XenServer 6.x the tuple of
<code>(vendor_name, model_name)</code> was used as the primary key, however this was not
ideal as these values are subject to change. XenServer 7.0 switched to a
<a href=%7b%7bsite.baseurl%7d%7d/xapi/futures/vgpu-type-identifiers.html>new primary key</a>
generated from static metadata, falling back to the old method for backwards
compatibility.</p><p>A <strong><code>VGPU_type</code></strong> will be garbage collected when there is no VGPU of that type
and there is no hardware which supports that type. On VM import, all VGPUs and
VGPU_types will be created if necessary - if this results in the creation of a
new VGPU_type then the VM will not be usable until the required hardware and

disks can be very large. Xapi starts by taking a snapshot and copying that to
the destination as a background task. Before the datapath connecting the VM
to the disk is re-established, xapi tells <code>tapdisk</code> to start mirroring all
writes to a remote <code>tapdisk</code> over NBD. From this point on all VM disk writes
are written to both the old and the new disk.
When the background snapshot copy is complete, xapi can migrate the VM memory
across. Once the VM memory image has been received, the destination VM is
complete and the original can be safely destroyed.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></section></div></main></div><script src=/new-docs/js/clipboard.min.js?1728900197 defer></script><script src=/new-docs/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1728900197 defer></script><script src=/new-docs/js/theme.js?1728900197 defer></script></body></html>
