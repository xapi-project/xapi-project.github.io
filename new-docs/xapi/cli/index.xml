Meanwhile, the CLI server code in xapi has been moved to a library separate from the main xapi binary, and has its own subdirectory ocaml/xapi-cli-server.
Architecture The actual CLI is a very lightweight binary in ocaml/xe-cli
It is just a dumb client, that does everything that xapi tells it to do This is a security issue We must trust the xenserver that we connect to, because it can tell xe to read local files, download files, â€¦ When it is first called, it takes the few command-line arguments it needs, and then passes the rest to xapi in a HTTP PUT request Each argument is in a separate line Then it loops doing what xapi tells it to do, in a loop, until xapi tells it to exit or an exception happens The protocol description is in ocaml/xapi-cli-protocol/cli_protocol.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/xapi/cli/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
