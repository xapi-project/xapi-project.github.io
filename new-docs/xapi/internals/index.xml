These certificates are using the PEM file format and reside in the Dom0 file system. This documents explains the purpose of these files.

This article aims to document some of these modules and how they relate to each other. The intention of this article is to serve as a developer resource and, as such, its contents are prone to change (or become inaccurate) as the codebase evolves. The ultimate source of truth remains the codebase itself.
Interface Description All of XenAPI’s data model is described within the ocaml/idl subdirectory.</description></item></channel></rss>
