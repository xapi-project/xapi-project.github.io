This article aims to document some of these modules and how they relate to each other. The intention of this article is to serve as a developer resource and, as such, its contents are prone to change (or become inaccurate) as the codebase evolves. The ultimate source of truth remains the codebase itself.
Interface Description All of XenAPIâ€™s data model is described within the ocaml/idl subdirectory.</description></item></channel></rss>
