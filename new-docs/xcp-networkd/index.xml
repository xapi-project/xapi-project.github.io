The code is in ocaml/networkd.
Principles Distro-agnostic. Networkd is meant to work on at least CentOS/RHEL as well a Debian/Ubuntu based distros. It therefore should not use any network configuration features specific to those distros.
Stateless. By default, networkd should not maintain any state.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/xcp-networkd/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Host Network Device Ordering on Networkd</title><link>https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/xcp-networkd/host-network-device-ordering-on-networkd/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/xcp-networkd/host-network-device-ordering-on-networkd/index.html</guid><description>How does the host network device ordering work on networkd.</description></item></channel></rss>
